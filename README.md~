PyInvaders - yet another space invaders clone
==========
Introduction:
PyInvaders, as its name implies, is a space invaders clone created in Python using the Pygame library. If you've been living a hole for the past decade(s) and have no clue what I'm talking about, space invaders is a game involving you, the player, piloting a ship whereby the objective is shoot down as many enemy ships (aka invaders) as possible, or for as long as a fingers will sustain the constant tapping (if you're good at the game that is). My version adds a variety of weapons; Ammunition and health depletion; the ability to shield your ship; an unlimited number of levels; coloured vector graphics, which were drawn completely in pygame btw; customisable colours and lastly modern sound effects. Of course, I'm still adding to the list of features available in my spin-off of this arcade classic, so please email me your suggestions.       

Installation:
The game was written in Python 2.7.3. You must install this version or any python 2.7.x or 2.8.x variant. If your using a modern linux distro such as SUSE, ubuntu or fedora or you are using a Macintosh computer, chances are you can skip this step as Python 2.7.x is pre-installed by default. 
Additionally Pygame will also need to be installed, otherwise the game won't run. You can download it from """
Once you've satisfied the above, just run the game with the command "python main.py" and the game will start.  

System Requirements:
Unfortunately I have not tested it on other systems other then my own. My system is running debian linux (wheezy) with Python 2.7.3 and pygame v1.8. Hardware wise, the system uses a intel core i3 2.2ghz, 2gb ram and intel HD 2000 graphics. The game runs at full speed, using very few resources (~80mb and ~25% CPU usage), so you can expect it to run on a much slower system such as a pentium IV machine. 

Issues:
-Sometimes there'll be no sound if you've recently unplugged/plugged a headphone or speaker. This is a technical issue with pygame and not the game itself. To resolve this just logout or restart the PC and rerun the game and the sound should work once again.  
-If youe screen is configured to use a low resolution, the window might appear cut off and you might not see your ship. There is no resolution (pun intended), to resolve this issue. I am currently working on a fullscreen option and possibly the ability to choose a smaller resolution as I write this README.  


Version Notes:
1.0 - Added option menu + fixed bug associated with level transition
1.1 - Title added to menu screen + resolved sound issues 

To be added:
-Fullscreen option + other resolutions?
-Ability to save scores
-Mystery?
